# Gesture Control System

A gesture-controlled system that allows users to interact with digital content such as slides and presentations using hand gestures. The system leverages machine learning and depth-sensing technologies to recognize custom gestures, providing an intuitive and accessible interface for users.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: High-accuracy gesture recognition powered by machine learning.
- **Slide Control**: Navigate and control slide presentations with hand gestures.
- **Custom Gestures**: Ability to define and use custom gestures for unique actions.
- **Pause and Resume**: Pause the presentation without closing the feed.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, OpenCV (for gesture recognition)
- **Speech Recognition**: Python SpeechRecognition library
- **Depth Sensing**: Depth-sensing technology (e.g., Kinect, RealSense)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Vue for interactive UI)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skyback12/S07-MINOR-PROJECT-GRS.git
```

### Run the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd D:/Project/backend
   ```

2. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py or flask run
   ```

### Run the Frontend
If your frontend is using a framework like React or Vue, you can run it by:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Open the backend and frontend in your preferred development environment.
2. Access the system via the browser (usually `http://localhost:5000` for Flask).
3. Use gestures and voice commands to interact with the system.

## Future Enhancements

- Improved accuracy for gesture recognition.
- Support for additional types of presentations (e.g., videos).
- Cross-platform support for various operating systems.
